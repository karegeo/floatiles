# Complexity from Simple Form: Aperiodic Monotiles & The Cheerios Effect

## Abstract
This project aims to create a macroscopic-scale physical experiment to explore the emergence of complex behaviors using simple foundational principles. By combining the Cheerios effect, a well-observed phenomenon in fluid dynamics, with the mathematically fascinating concept of aperiodic monotiles, we seek to manifest and investigate intricate emergent patterns.

## Introduction

**Purpose**: 
- Investigate how fundamental principles can give rise to complex emergent behaviors in physical systems.
- Offer a tangible, visual representation of theoretical concepts, making them more accessible and compelling.

**Why it Matters**:
Emergent phenomena are pervasive in nature, from flocking birds to economic systems. This experiment provides a controlled environment to understand the underlying principles behind such occurrences.

## Background

### The Cheerios Effect
- A phenomenon where floating objects (like cereal in milk) clump together or cling to container sides.
- Governed by three physics concepts:
  - Buoyancy: Determines whether an object floats.
  - Surface Tension: Causes the liquid's surface to behave like a flexible membrane.
  - Meniscus Effect: Causes the liquid to curve where it meets the container.

### Aperiodic Monotiles
- Geometric shapes that, when tiled, don't produce a repeating pattern.
- "The hat" and "Spectre" shapes are recent discoveries in this domain.
- Such tiles possess both mathematical beauty and potential for real-world applications.

## Methods

### Experiment Setup:
1. **Materials**: Used 3D printers to produce buoyant objects inspired by the recent aperiodic monotile discoveries.
2. **Procedure**: Floated the 3D-printed shapes on water surfaces.
3. **Observations**: Watched for aggregation and the resultant unique patterns formed by these shapes under the influence of the Cheerios effect.

### Observations:
- Different shapes led to varied patterns and formations.
- Vibration, either from external motors or manual input, influenced the speed and nature of the aggregation process.

## Results & Analysis

- The aperiodic monotiles, when floated on water, exhibit the Cheerios effect, resulting in unique and unpredictable patterns.
- The emergent patterns observed showcased a bridge between mathematical concepts and real-world physics phenomena.
- The behavior of these tiles, especially under influence, can mimic the results of diffusion-limited aggregation simulations.

## Future Implications & Applications
- **Scientific Understanding**: A better grasp of emergent behaviors in physical systems.
- **Art & Design**: Inspiration for non-repetitive patterns and designs.
- **Technology**: Potentially, the development of new materials or systems based on aperiodic patterns.
